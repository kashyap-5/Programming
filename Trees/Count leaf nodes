Problem Description : Given a generic tree, count and return the number of leaf nodes present in the given tree.

Time Complexity : O(N)
Space Complexity : O(H) 
where N is the number of nodes and H is the height/depth of the tree.

int getLeafNodeCount(TreeNode<int>* root) {
    // Write your code here
    int count = 0;
    
    if(root->children.size() == 0)count++;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < root->children.size();i++){
         count=count + getLeafNodeCount(root->children[i]);
    }
    return count;
}
